# Project Name
> Outline a brief description of your project.

This project is used to build a regularised linear regression model that would provide the factors that affect the price of a property in Australia market so that the business can predict actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.


- What is the background of your project?

A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.  

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. We are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?
The company wants to know:

1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

2. How well those variables describe the price of a house.

- What is the dataset that is being used?

The company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

## Conclusions
- Ridge Regression provides a better accuracy as per our analysis. 
- The top 5 predictor variables in Ridge are 'GrLivArea', 'OverallQual_Very Excellent', '2ndFlrSF', 'RoofMatl_WdShngl' and '1stFlrSF'.
- The optimal value of lasso is 0.001 and ridge is 2.
